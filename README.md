# MLP-2020
This repository contains code for a second-year artificial intelligence methods coursework, which implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch for simple regression modelling. The model is therefore restricted to forward propagation and backpropagation. The coursework utilises the activation functions, sigmoid and tanh along with their respective derivatives. Additionally, optimisations such as annealing, momentum, and weight decay are implemented.
